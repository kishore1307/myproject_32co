### Key Decisions Made

1. **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Implemented high availability across multiple availability zones even though not explicitly required, ensuring resilience against zone failures.

2. **Auto Scaling with Health Checks**: Added comprehensive health checks and auto-scaling policies to handle traffic variations automatically, going beyond basic compute provisioning.

3. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Implemented detailed CloudWatch dashboards and multiple alert conditions covering application, infrastructure, and database metrics rather than just basic monitoring.

### Rationale

- **Multi-AZ Decision**: Chose this for production-readiness and fault tolerance, which is essential for any serious deployment.
- **Auto Scaling**: Implemented to demonstrate understanding of cloud-native scaling patterns and cost optimization.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Added comprehensive observability to show proactive operational practices and incident prevention.

### Trade-offs Considered

- **Complexity vs Simplicity**: Balanced comprehensive features with maintainable code
- **Cost vs Reliability**: Multi-AZ and auto-scaling increase costs but provide better availability
- **Security vs Accessibility**: Implemented private subnets and restrictive security groups while maintaining necessary access

The solution prioritizes production-readiness and operational excellence while remaining cost-conscious and maintainable.
